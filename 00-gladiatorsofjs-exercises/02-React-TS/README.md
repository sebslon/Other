## React & TypeScript

All solutions are in `"solutions"` folder.

Projects are separated by routes (pages), that means every project has its implementation contained in `"pages"` directory. For example `"/solutions/src/pages/1-ReactTS_Fundamentals/..."`

Below are short descriptions, longer descriptions are in `"zadania"` (eng: exercises) directories in each folder above solutions.

For now, to run live the projects download `"solutions"` folder and install all dependencies (npm install/yarn), then run npm/yarn start.

Projects are listed by difficulty (from easier in the beginning).
