## Encryption with PGP

On a high-level the process between a sender and receiver looks like this:

1. The recipient generates public and private keys.
2. The recipient sends its public key to the sender.
3. The sender encrypts the message using the given public key.
4. The sender sends the encrypted message to the recipient.
5. The recipient decrypts the message using its private key.
